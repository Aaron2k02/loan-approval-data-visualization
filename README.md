### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
Using **Excel**:
- **Imputation**:  
  - Categorical: Mode-based imputation.  
  - Numerical: Median-based imputation to address outliers.  
- **Dynamic Formulas in Excel**:  
  - Mode: `=INDEX(A2:A50, MATCH(MAX(COUNTIF(A2:A50, A2:A50)), COUNTIF(A2:A50, A2:A50), 0))`  
  - Median: `=MEDIAN(A2:A50)`

### 2. Feature Engineering  
Using **Excel**:
Key features were added to enhance analysis and storytelling:  
- **Dependents Category**: Grouped as "None," "Single," "Couple," or "Many."  
- **Loan Term Category**: Converted durations (e.g., 360 â†’ "30 years").  
- **Credit History Category**: Grouped into "Good Credit" and "Bad Credit."  
- **Loan Status Category**: Labeled as "Approved" or "Rejected."  
- **Total Income**: Combined Applicant and Coapplicant Income.  
- **Loan Amount per Term**: Loan amount divided by term length to evaluate financial burden.

### 6.1 Credit History  
- **Heatmap**:  
  - Approved loan amounts for good credit: **46.17M**.  
  - Approved loan amounts for bad credit: **0.71M**.  
- **Pie Chart**:  
  - Good credit applicants received **85.54%** of the total approved loans, highlighting the importance of creditworthiness.  
- **Key Insight**: Lending criteria could be refined to better meet the needs of applicants with lower credit scores. Special loan products for rejected good-credit applicants could improve approval rates while managing risk.

### 6.2 Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)  
- Applicants with higher DTIs face higher rejection rates, highlighting financial institutions' preference for manageable debt levels.  
- **Key Insight**:  
  - Longer loan terms could mitigate the impact of high DTIs.  
  - The dashboard emphasizes the interplay between DTI, loan terms, and credit history.

### 6.3 Demographics and Risk Level  
- Semi-urban areas had the highest approval rates. Graduates in these areas also saw higher success rates, suggesting a mix of education and local economic conditions influences approvals.  
- **Key Insight**: Policymakers could address demographic disparities through financial literacy programs and targeted support for underserved groups.
